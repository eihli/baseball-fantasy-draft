# Fantasy Baseball League Draft Analysis

Update: 2015-01-29-21:16
The rules of this league are the same as Yahoo's Head to Head.
There are 5 hitting categories and 5 pitching categories.
You are competing head to head against a different team each week and you
get a point for each category you beat your opponent.

My ranking system will be to simulate each player against each other player using
projected 2015 stats. Each win is worth a point.
Players will then be ranked by points.

Probably going to do this with Python/Pandas.
Started off with an IPython Notebook.
